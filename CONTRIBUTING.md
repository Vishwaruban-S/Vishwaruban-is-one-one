# Contributing to is-one-one 

Welcome! This project is an **Educational Sandbox** designed for first-time contributors to practice the professional Open Source workflow. Our goal is to prove that `1 == 1` using the most unnecessarily complex (but technically sound) methods possible.

## Project Goals
1. **Education:** Help developers practice Forking, Branching, and Pull Requests.
2. **Experimentation:** Try out complex Python libraries (NumPy, SymPy, etc.) to solve simple logic.
3. **Quality:** Maintain high standards of CI/CD and automated testing, even for "useless" code.

## How to Contribute
1. **Find an Issue:** Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
2. **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repository to your account and clone it locally.
3. **Write Overengineered Code:** We don't want `1 == 1`. We want complex logic, API calls, or deep recursion to find the truth.
4. **Pass the CI:** Make sure your code doesn't break the core logic. Your PR must pass the GitHub Actions check (`verify.yml`).
5. **Submit PR:** Open a Pull Request, explain your chaotic logic, and link it to the issue you're solving!

## Development Setup
To ensure your contribution meets our "Professional Chaos" standards:
- **Local Testing:** Run `python test_core.py` to verify your logic.
- **Pytest:** We recommend using `pytest` to run tests and see detailed reports.
- **Organization:** If your logic is very complex, feel free to add a new module, but ensure the main entry point stays in `is_one_one.py`.

## Our Engineering Philosophy
In this repo, we value **Technical Complexity** over **Simplicity**.
- **Requirement:** Your code must be syntactically correct and pass all tests.
- **Learning:** This is a safe space. If your CI fails, don't worry! Check the logs, learn from the error, and push a fix.
